TECHNICAL REFERENCE MANUAL - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND DEPLOYMENT

CHAPTER 1: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The system architecture follows a microservices-based approach with containerized deployments across multiple availability zones. Each service operates independently with its own database and message queue, ensuring fault isolation and independent scaling capabilities.

Core Components:
- API Gateway: Handles request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and load balancing
- Service Registry: Maintains service discovery and health monitoring
- Message Broker: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services
- Configuration Server: Centralized configuration management with environment-specific settings
- Monitoring Stack: Comprehensive observability including metrics, logs, and distributed tracing

Service Communication Patterns:
Services communicate through REST APIs for synchronous operations and message queues for asynchronous workflows. Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures, while retry mechanisms with exponential backoff handle transient failures. All inter-service communication uses mutual TLS authentication.

CHAPTER 2: DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES

Blue-Green Deployment:
Production environments utilize blue-green deployment strategies to minimize downtime during updates. The inactive environment receives updates and undergoes comprehensive testing before traffic switchover. Database migrations run independently to ensure compatibility with both versions.

Canary Releases:
Critical services employ canary deployment patterns, gradually rolling out changes to a subset of users. Metrics collection during canary phases enables automatic rollback upon detecting anomalies. Success criteria include error rates, response times, and business metrics.

Rolling Updates:
Non-critical services use rolling updates with configurable batch sizes and wait periods. Health checks ensure each instance is ready before proceeding. Failed deployments trigger automatic rollback to the previous stable version.

CHAPTER 3: SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

Horizontal Scaling:
Services scale horizontally based on CPU utilization, memory usage, and custom metrics. Auto-scaling policies define minimum and maximum instances with cooldown periods to prevent flapping. Load balancers distribute traffic using least-connections algorithms.

Database Scaling:
Read replicas handle query load distribution while write operations route to primary instances. Sharding strategies partition data based on tenant ID or geographic region. Connection pooling optimizes database resource utilization.

Caching Strategies:
Multi-tier caching includes CDN for static assets, Redis for session data, and application-level caching for computed results. Cache invalidation uses event-driven patterns to maintain consistency. TTL values balance freshness with performance.

CHAPTER 4: SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

Authentication and Authorization:
OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens provides stateless authentication. Role-based access control (RBAC) enforces fine-grained permissions. Token refresh mechanisms maintain session continuity without re-authentication.

Encryption:
Data encryption at rest uses AES-256 with key rotation policies. TLS 1.3 secures data in transit with perfect forward secrecy. Hardware security modules (HSMs) protect cryptographic keys.

Security Monitoring:
Intrusion detection systems monitor network traffic for anomalies. Security information and event management (SIEM) aggregates logs for threat analysis. Automated responses isolate compromised components.

CHAPTER 5: DISASTER RECOVERY

Backup Strategies:
Automated backups run on scheduled intervals with point-in-time recovery capabilities. Incremental backups minimize storage requirements while maintaining recovery point objectives. Off-site replication ensures geographic redundancy.

Recovery Procedures:
Documented recovery procedures include step-by-step runbooks for various failure scenarios. Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) guide restoration priorities. Regular disaster recovery drills validate procedures.

Business Continuity:
Failover mechanisms automatically redirect traffic to standby regions during outages. Data synchronization maintains consistency across regions. Communication plans ensure stakeholder notification during incidents.

CHAPTER 6: MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY

Metrics Collection:
Application metrics include response times, error rates, and throughput. Infrastructure metrics monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization. Business metrics track user engagement and transaction volumes.

Logging Architecture:
Structured logging with correlation IDs enables request tracing across services. Log aggregation centralizes data for analysis and alerting. Log retention policies balance compliance requirements with storage costs.

Alerting Strategy:
Alert rules define thresholds for critical metrics with severity levels. Escalation policies ensure appropriate response based on incident priority. Alert fatigue reduction through intelligent grouping and suppression.

CHAPTER 7: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

Code Optimization:
Profiling identifies performance bottlenecks in critical code paths. Algorithm optimization reduces computational complexity. Memory management prevents leaks and optimizes garbage collection.

Database Optimization:
Query optimization includes index tuning and execution plan analysis. Connection pooling reduces overhead from connection establishment. Batch operations minimize round trips to the database.

Network Optimization:
Content compression reduces bandwidth requirements. HTTP/2 multiplexing improves concurrent request handling. Geographic distribution through CDNs minimizes latency.
