# Vector Database Technologies

## Introduction
Vector databases have revolutionized semantic search and machine learning applications. They enable efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors representing various data types.

## Technical Architecture
Modern vector databases use specialized indexing algorithms like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) and IVF (Inverted File) to enable fast approximate nearest neighbor search.

### Key Components:
1. **Vector Storage Engine**: Optimized for high-dimensional data
2. **Indexing Layer**: HNSW, LSH, or IVF algorithms
3. **Query Processing**: Real-time similarity search
4. **Metadata Filtering**: Combined vector and scalar queries

## Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond query response times
- **Throughput**: Millions of queries per second
- **Accuracy**: >95% recall in most applications
- **Scalability**: Billions of vectors supported

## Use Cases
Vector databases excel in:
- Semantic search applications
- Recommendation systems
- Computer vision tasks
- Natural language processing
- Anomaly detection systems

## Integration Patterns
Modern applications integrate vector databases through:
- REST APIs for web applications
- gRPC for high-performance services
- Client libraries in multiple languages
- Cloud-native deployment options
